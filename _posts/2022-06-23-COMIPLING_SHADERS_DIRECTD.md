Note: This post is still in progress (don't worry I am working on it almost everyday, I didn't abandon it and it will be ready very soon). However, feel free to message me about improving the current draft if you have any ideas :smile:

While learning Direct3D12 and working on my game engine [Mizu](https://github.com/TheSharpOwl/Mizu) I found that there are many ways to compile shaders but there is not clear documentation about the differences and how to apply them (especially if you are using CMake as a build system). Therefore, as usual no clear documentation? Time to write a post on the blog )

To be continued...
