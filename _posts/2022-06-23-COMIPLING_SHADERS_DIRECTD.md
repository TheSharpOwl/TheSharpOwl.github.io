Note: This post is still in progress (don't worry I am working on it almost everyday, I didn't abandon it and it will be ready very soon). However, feel free to message me about improving the current draft if you have any ideas :smile:

While learning Direct3D12 and working on my game engine [Mizu](https://github.com/TheSharpOwl/Mizu) I found that there are many ways to compile shaders but there is not clear documentation about the differences and how to apply them (especially if you are using CMake as a build system). Therefore, as usual no clear documentation? Time to write a post on the blog )


As a start I will be using Microsoft's Hello Triangle example from the [D3D12HelloWorld example](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12HelloWorld). Of course Visual Studio is needed (I am using 2022 version and 2015, 2017 should work for you as long as you have the suitable windows sdk)
