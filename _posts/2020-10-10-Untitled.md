You may have a compilers course and wanna learn how to use Bison with your other code. When I had this course I got in a big confusion while trying to use Bison with a Hand 
Written parser (in my opinion documentation isn't easy for a bachelor and the deadline won't wait for you to read all of it). As a result, I had to ask people just to know how to make Bison use my functions instead of Flex's (most code on internet Flex is used). Well, I finished the course (with not much disaster, thank God) and wanted to write here about it !

Let's start with a brief introduction to be sure that we are on the same page. **Compiler Construction consists of the following stages:**

1. Token producer or Scanner
2. Parser
3. Parsing Tree Design (just design)
4. Construction and adding nodes to the tree
5. Semantics (make sure an expression is valid for example)
6. Machine Code generation (LLVM code for example)


**Note : In my case it was a compiled langauge so if you are doing an interpreter, some things will be different for you.**

1. Use linux or linux shell on windows because latest Bison is not supported for windows.<br>

2.  **[Install the latest version from here](https://launchpad.net/bison/head/3.7.2) not from package manager**. because sometimes it doesn't install the latest one for some reason....
3. Let's say we only have this rule/case (any variable name with letters and underscores works)

```
var some_variable is integer
```

4. A dummy Scanner just to explain the idea : 

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>

FILE* fptr;

// returns 0 when the file is completely read
int get_next_token()
{
    char s[1002], c;
    int len = 0;

    while(1)
    {
        c = getc(fptr);

        if(c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == EOF)
        {
            if(len == 0) // we only have this character
            {
                if(c == EOF)
                    return 0;

                // we can print it
                printf("%c",c);
                return 1;
            }
            else
            {
            // add NULL termination at the end so that strcmp will know the ending of our array
             s[len] = '\0'; 

             if(strcmp(s,"var") == 0) // the last word is var
                printf("VAR");
             else if(strcmp(s,"integer") == 0)
                printf("INT");
             else if(strcmp(s,"is") == 0)
                printf("IS");
             else if(len > 0)// it means it is some identifier (if there's misplacment the grammar will discover it :D )
                printf("IDENT");
            // now we need to put the pointer exactly after the word (undo last step to reread ONLY the 'non letter or underscore')
             ungetc(c, fptr);
            //reset the char array
             memset(s, 0, sizeof(s));
             len = 0;
             return 1;
            }
        }
        else if ((c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') || c == '_') // reading some name
        {
            s[len++] = c;
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%s + Unknown symbol! ", s);
            //reset the char array
            memset(s, 0, sizeof(s));
            len = 0;
            // stop everything 
            return 0;
        }    
    }
}
int main()
{
    fptr = fopen("input.txt", "r+");

    while(get_next_token() != 0);

    printf("\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

5. Now the Bison part. I won't go deep into grammar rules and the way you design them (I learned grammar in Theoretical Computer Science course) but I will talk about the programming aspects. <br> <br>
Bison file consists of 3 parts :
    1.  C code part(s) for includes and signatures (will be at the beginning of the generated .h file)
    2. Grammar part
    3. Function defintions part
<br>

6. Let's take a look at this example and I will explain it after that :

```
%require "3.2"
%define api.pure full

%code requires
{
    // note that these are imported at the beginning of parser.tab.h in the generated C file 
    // so you might not need it (in my case I don't but just to clarify)
}
%code
{
    int yylex(YYSTYPE *lvalp);
    void yyerror(const char *error);
    // note that this is added after including parser.tab.h in parser.tab.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>

    // TODO delete
    int temp = 1;
}

%token IDENT VAR INT IS


%union {
    // put all the types you want to use here with any identical name
    // then in types section put its name such as 'st' below
    char st[1002];
}

%type<st> IDENT

%%
Empty:
;
VariableDeclaration: VAR IDENT IS INT {
    /* this is called an action*/
     printf("defined a variable %s with type int\n", $2);
     }
;

%%

void yyerror(const char *error)
{
    printf("Syntax Error\n");
}

int yylex(YYSTYPE *lvalp)
{
    return YYEOF;
}
```
* The first line holds a condition of the least required version of Bison to run our file.
* The second line declares that we want to use our own scanner (pure calling). Take a look at this [link](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Pure-Calling.html) (don't worry about understanding it 100%).
* Code-requires and Code blocks.
* Union, which contains a variable to each type we want to return with a unique name for each and Bison will generate them as data members to ``lvalp`` in ``yylex`` function.
* In general, Bison has 3 important functions:

    1. ``yylex(lvalp)`` which is similar in logic to our ``get_next_token`` except that you have to return predefined token (we will see them in a little bit) and if you have a token which corresponds to a value, you have to put its value inside ``lvalp`` member. In our case, if we see an identifier, we should copy its name to ``lvalp->st`` since ``st`` is in the union.
    <br>
    For the defined tokens, if you generate .c and .h files from this bison using :

         ```Bison -d file_name.y```

        then you can see at the beginning :
        ```
        enum yytokentype
        {
        YYEMPTY = -2,
        YYEOF = 0,                     /* "end of   file"  */
        YYerror = 256,                 /* error  */
        YYUNDEF = 257,                 /* "invalid  token"  */
        IDENT = 258,                   /* IDENT  */
        VAR = 259,                     /* VAR  */
        INT = 260,                     /* INT  */
        IS = 261                       /* IS  */
        };
       ```
       Well, ``yylex(YYSTYPE lvalp)`` returns one of these enum values and knows which value to get from ``lvalp`` when we return ``IDENT`` for example because in Bison we wrote that the type of ``IDENT`` is ``st`` which is a char array.
